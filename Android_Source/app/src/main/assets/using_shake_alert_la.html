<p>The ShakeAlertâ„¢ Earthquake Early Warning
    System (EEW) is under development by United
    States Geological Survey (USGS) and its
    academic partners at the California Institute of
    Technology; the University of California, Berkeley;
    the University of Oregon; and the University of
    Washington. This development includes in close
    partnership and collaboration with State Partners
    from California, Oregon, and Washington
    Emergency Management and Geological Surveys.<br/><br/></p>


<p>The USGS, in collaboration, with its academic
    partners run the seismic network which is a
    system of sensors that detects an earthquake
    when it starts. When an earthquake starts it
    produces two kinds of seismic waves that carry
    energy through the Earth. The waves are
    detected by the sensors which send the
    information to a computer system faster than
    the seismic waves travel. The system analyzes
    the ground motion data and provides an
    earthquake alert which includes rapid estimates
    of the magnitude, location, and expected
    intensity of shaking. Earthquake magnitude
    (Mag) represents the amount of energy released
    and depends on the surface area of the rupture.
    Seismic intensity (MMI) is the amount of shaking,
    and is a relevant measure for potential damage.
    When the earthquake reaches the pre-set
    threshold of magnitude and intensity of shaking
    an alert is triggered. The amount of warning time
    depends on the speed of the warning mechanism
    and your distance from the earthquake. You may
    receive as little as a few seconds to minutes of
    warning time.</p>
