        ShakeAlert warnings will be issued for all earthquakes (including aftershocks) over a set magnitude threshold of 4.5 or level III intensity, which is the level that can begin to create damage
        and affect public safety. You can also see the history of all recent earthquakes over magnitude 3.0 listed under “View recent earthquakes”
        These alerts apply to the LA County area only.
        The alert will include an initial alert sound and message such as alert sounds and “Earthquake! Earthquake! Expect (no, weak, moderate, strong) shaking. Drop, cover, and hold on. Protect yourself now!”.
    </p>
        <p>
        When an earthquake starts, it may take a while for the shaking to reach you. ShakeAlertLA alerts you that shaking has started close by so that you can get to a safe place.
        </p>
       
       <p>
        The alert will pop up on your phone (even if the app is closed), similar to an Amber Alert.

        If you tap “Dismiss” the alert will go away, but you can find the information on the Active Alert or Recent Earthquakes screens.

        If you tap “Show on a map”, you will be taken to a map with the location for you and the epicenter of the earthquake.
